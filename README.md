systems • security • automation • ML/AI

I work at the intersection of systems, security, automation, and ML/AI.

My projects focus on understanding how operating systems, networks, and cloud environments behave in practice, how state changes propagate, how security controls affect behaviour, and how automation and data-driven approaches can be applied safely.

Most of the work here is experimental and built to deepen understanding rather than production use.
