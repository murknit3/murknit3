# Hi, I’m murknit3 👾

🔴 Red teamer in training — focused on AV evasion, in-memory execution, and adversary emulation.  
🛠️ Building shellcode loaders, injection tools, and HTA attack chains using C#.  
💣 I reverse engineer, break protections, and share what I learn.

### 🔧 Skills
- C# malware development
- Shellcode execution (VirtualAlloc, CreateThread)
- AV/EDR evasion (sandbox detection, in-memory)
- Wi-Fi attacks (Airodump-ng, Hashcat)
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping

### 🧪 Current Projects
- XOR-encrypted shellcode loaders in C#
- Process injection into trusted binaries (notepad.exe)
- HTA delivery with remote C2
- AV/EDR evasion experiments
